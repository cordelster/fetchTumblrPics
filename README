fetchTumblrPics - Fetches pictures from tumblr-streams via RSS, HTML, API.

Files:
fetchTumblrPics.pl - the script itself. Call with -d <file> to use a
	configuration file other than fetchTumblrPics.conf. 
fetchTumblrPics.fetched - file to store the URIs we've already fetched.
	Note: It's a known TODO to apply timestamps to keep this "cache"
	small. It'll get quite big at the moment, as every file is an entry.
fetchTumblrPics.conf - Configuration file. See fetchTumblrPics.conf.example
	for an example!

Usage:
Trigger the script by cron as often as you need to get the complete stream.
File won't be downloaded twice as long as they're mentioned in
fetchTumblrPics.fetched.
We do honor environment proxy settings like
"export http_proxy=http://localhost:8118" for Tor/Privoxy.

License:
There is no license. Do whatever you want. Please, if you're going to im-
prove it, drop me a note and send patches ;-)
